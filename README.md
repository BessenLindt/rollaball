# rollaball
Implementation of Unity tutorial game with Fabric code wired up how I like it.

This is a very simple game. The game itself comes from [a tutorial](http://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/roll-a-ball) on the Unity website.

This example demonstrates how to setup Fabric audio middleware in Unity so that a project is ready to use it in any of its scenes. Fabric is NOT free software. It can be obtained at [Tazman Audio's website](http://www.tazman-audio.co.uk/#!fabric/c1oba "Fabric")
